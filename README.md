# NVL-UCS

Summary

Northern VoIP and Ecosmob are entering into a strategic partnership to develop the NVL Unified Communications System. This innovative solution is a mobile application that will be available on both Android and iOS platforms. The NVL Unified Communications System will seamlessly integrate with the Xumm Wallet and XRPL.

Narrative

Northern VoIP and Ecosmob have teamed up to create the NVL Unified Communications System (NVL UCS), a comprehensive mobile application that can be downloaded free of charge from the Android or iOS stores. The app offers a wide range of features, including instant messaging, voice and video calls, SMS, voicemail, call recording, and more. The primary target audience for the NVL UCS will be XUMM Wallet users and the XRPL community.

The idea for the NVL UCS arose from David Johnson's experience as the founder and CEO of Northern VoIP, a company that specializes in providing high-quality voice over IP (VoIP) services to businesses. David recognized the need for comprehensive communications system that would meet the needs of modern businesses and consumers. He also saw an opportunity to leverage the growing interest in blockchain technology to provide users with an innovative and secure way to communicate.

The NVL UCS is designed to solve several problems that currently exist in the communications space. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of a truly comprehensive platform that integrates all the features users need in one place. Most existing solutions are either too basic or too complicated, and they often require users to juggle multiple applications and services to meet their needs. The NVL UCS aims to change that by offering a single, unified platform that includes all of the key features users need to communicate effectively.

Another problem the NVL UCS aims to solve is the lack of security and privacy in many existing communications solutions. Traditional communications platforms are often vulnerable to hacking and other forms of cyber attacks, which can compromise users' personal and business data. The NVL UCS will incorporate advanced security measures, including firewall protection and user authentication through Xumm Wallet, to ensure that users' data is protected at all times.

The NVL UCS is being built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including XRPL, Xumm, and VoIP. The app will leverage the power of the XRPL and XUMM to facilitate user authentication and subscription payments, and include a secure and easy-to-use interface for users to manage their accounts. VoIP technology will enable users to make high-quality voice and video calls over the internet, without the need for traditional telephone lines.

Northern VoIP and Ecosmob will follow a detailed roadmap that outlines the key milestones they need to achieve in order to complete the project. The first step is to develop the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which will include all of the core features of the NVL UCS, as well as support for inbound and outbound SIP calling and SMS messaging. The MVP will be released for Android and iOS devices, and users will log in using their Xumm Wallet and pay for a monthly or annual subscription.

Once the MVP has been released, the team will focus on expanding the platform to include additional features and modules that will meet the needs of businesses and other groups. These features may include advanced call routing, conference calling, and more.

In terms of licensing, the NVL UCS will be made available under a commercial license that will allow businesses and organizations to use the platform for a fee. It will also be open-source to encourage community participation and collaboration.

In summary, the NVL Unified Communications System is an innovative and comprehensive mobile application that aims to solve many of the problems that currently exist in the communications space. By leveraging the power of XRPL, Xumm, and VoIP technology, the NVL UCS will provide users with a secure, easy-to-use, and unified platform that meets all of their needs.
